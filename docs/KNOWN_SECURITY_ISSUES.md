### CVE-2024-23342 - ecdsa Minerva Timing Attack

**Package**: `ecdsa==0.19.1` (transitive dependency via `python-jose`)
**Severity**: 🔴 HIGH (CVSS 7.4)
**Discovered**: January 2024
**Status**: ⚠️ ACCEPTED RISK

#### Vulnerability Description

The `python-ecdsa` package is vulnerable to a Minerva timing attack on the P-256 elliptic curve. An attacker can analyze timing differences in ECDSA signature operations to potentially extract the private key.

**Affected Components**:
- ECDSA signatures (ES256, ES384, ES512 algorithms)
- ECDSA key generation
- ECDH operations

**Not Affected**:
- ECDSA signature verification
- HMAC-based algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512)

#### Impact on Our Project

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW**

**Reason**: This project uses **HS256 (HMAC SHA256)** for JWT signing, NOT elliptic curve algorithms.

**Evidence**:
```python
# src/config/settings.py
ALGORITHM: str = os.getenv("ALGORITHM", "HS256")  # HMAC, not ECDSA
```

**Code Analysis**:
- ✅ No usage of ES256/ES384/ES512 algorithms
- ✅ No ECDSA key generation
- ✅ No P-256/secp256r1 curve usage
- ✅ No ECDH operations

#### Remediation Status

**Fix Available**: ❌ NO

The `python-ecdsa` maintainers consider this vulnerability **out of scope** with the reasoning:
> "Implementing side-channel free code in pure python is impossible"

**No fix is planned.**

#### Our Decision

**Action**: ACCEPT RISK - No mitigation required

**Rationale**:
1. We don't use the vulnerable functionality (ECDSA)
2. No fix is available from upstream
3. Switching algorithms is unnecessary given no actual risk
4. Removing the dependency would require replacing `python-jose` with alternatives

#### Monitoring

**Conditions for Re-evaluation**:
- ⚠️ If we switch to ES256/ES384/ES512 algorithms → **CRITICAL**
- ⚠️ If a fix becomes available → Update dependency
- ⚠️ If we implement ECDSA key generation → Migrate to `cryptography` library

**Alternative Solutions** (if needed in future):
1. Replace `python-jose` with `PyJWT[crypto]` (uses `cryptography` backend)
2. Use `cryptography` library directly for JWT operations
3. Implement custom JWT handler with `cryptography`
